## 1. Keyboard Configuration 🎹


The keyboard configuration perfectly summarizes the entire approach of all digital devices as well and their underlying operating systems. 

The ultimate goal of taking control via **1 key to go/be mentally**.


<p float="left">
    <img src="https://png.pngtree.com/png-vector/20250518/ourmid/pngtree-elegant-golden-key-with-intricate-designs-depicted-on-a-transparent-background-png-image_16281536.png" width=200 />
    <img src="https://blueseatblogs.com/cdn-cgi/image/quality=80,format=auto,onerror=redirect,metadata=none/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/consciousness-709143.jpg" width=200 />
</p>

It can be applied to any computer with all operating systems and/or mobile device. Additionally, it will also be used in order to set up virtual working spaces on different (virtual) desktops.

In general, this also aims to help you to structure thought processes. Use AutoHotkey scripts already present in *C:\Users\<username>\.config\AutoHotkey* on windows machines and */home/(user)/.config/autokey/data* folder on linux machines. There always exist the opportunity to create new scripts.

At some point in the future, the aim will be to learn more and improve efficiency by establishing a new workflow with a glove(80) keyboard (https://www.moergo.com/) or a kinesis keyboard (https://kinesis-ergo.com/products/#adv360). But it only makes sense as soon as the owner really stays at one location (too uncomfy for travel) - current setup is perfect!

> - Is it beyond my knowledge? Is it time-sensitive? → (SEARCH)  
> - Derive it from 1st principles? (→ THINK) uncertain? (1st THINK then SEARCH)<br /><br />
> ⛔ ***avoid***: searching to procrastinate thinking & using search to confirm biases & accepting 1st result without evaluation & searching for derivable answers<br /><br />
> **TODO**:<br />

> browsing = navigating information environments to extract structured knowledge (targeted) or discover new/unstructured signals (exploratory) 
> - cost of browsing = time (high), attention drift, risk of distraction

> - optimization goal: synthesis & signal not consumption or exploration for its own sake
> - Is it a known source? Is structured info available? → (BROWSE)
> - Is it unstructured/novel space? exploratory mode → (DISCOVER)
> - Could a snippet or search suffice? → (SEARCH) or (THINK)<br /><br />
    > ⛔ ***avoid***: browsing without clear extraction goal or when search snippet suffices as well as inefficient discovery<br /><br />
> **TODO**:<br /> 
> What am I browsing for? How will I extract value?
> 1. clear objective (depth, synthesis, novelity) synthesize → think → apply
> 2. targeted vs exploratory

> ⛔ avoid: acting on emotion (FOMO, fear, greed, boredom) & trading without proven edge & risking undefined amounts & optimizing on insufficient sample size & chasing confirmation or crowd consensus & overtrading, overallocating, overconfidence & mistaking price movement for thesis validation<br /><br />
> **TODO**:<br /> 
> Edge → Position Size → Execute → Review (emotion breaks chain)<br />
> 1. Do I have a (statiscal) edge? Is this decision probabilistically sound?
> 2. Thesis clarity – why this asset / trade / bet? What is your core belief?
> 3. Timeframe – short-term (trade) or long-term (invest)?
> 4. Asymmetry (what’s the upside vs downside?)
> 5. Risk sizing (risk mathematically defined?)
> 6. Independent signal (based on which impluse/group think?)
> 7. Entry / Exit / Invalidation 
> 8. Feedback loop (track performance, review mistakes, refine thesis)
> 9. Portfolio/Strategy/Goal fit
> 10. Can I execute this repeatedly?

important commands:
- `route`: check if other ip adresses communicate with MAC adress
- `ifconfig`: check networks
- `iwconfig`: check wirless networks
- `touch`: create new file
- `vim`: vim into file
- `nano`: nano into file

- `z foo`: jump to the highest-ranked directory matching foo.
- `z ~/foo`: works just like cd, allowing navigation to absolute paths.
- `z .`: move up one directory level.
- `z -`: return to the previous directory.
- `z desk`  - home/garryhost/

- `curl https://www.cnbc.com/world/?region=us | html2text`: websearch: (eg. cnbc)

**pentesting 0.0**:

1. webserver:

- creating webserver: `service apache2` start / stop and then use `python3 -m http.server 80` or
- other alternative just move in the the folder which you want to establish and start by using only `python-3m http-server 80` and it will appear there
- if you want to access it from another machine in the local network you have to bind it `sudo python3 	-m http.server 80 --bind 0.0.0.0`

2. start everytime you boot (and open the program then): `systemctl enable/disable ssh` or whatever e.g. `systemctl enable postresql (database)`

3. ARP cache can reveal recently connected devices: `cat /proc/net/arp`

4. check for wifi/internetconnection: basic commands:
- `ifconfig/iwconfig`: 
- `ping (IP)`: 
- `arp-a`: show ip adress + mac-adresses an)
- `netsat -ano`: show all connections on the machine whats open + talking
- `route`: where traffic exists
- `nmcli device show`
- `ip addr show`: check for wifi/internetconnection
- `curl ifconfig.me`: check for wifi/internetconnection if in vm (external ip adress
- `for ip in $(cat ip_list.txt); do nmap -sS -p  80 -T4 $ip & done`: check if ports open/closed

5. ip sweep:
```
#!/bin/bash
if [ "$1" == "" ]
then 
echo "you forgot IP adress - check for IP adress and insert it"

else
for ip in $(seq 1 254); do     
ping -c 1 $1.$ip | grep "64 bytes" | cut -d " " -f 4 | tr -d ":" &
done
fi

## 6. NVIM/VIM Configuration 🍌 

![Neovim Logo](https://media4.giphy.com/media/v1.Y2lkPTc5MGI3NjExc2NnMnRreDA4aTN5MDFlbXVuN2R2ZWNweXR6ZGRhaWpwcXRvbm44dSZlcD12MV9pbnRlcm5hbF9naWZfYnlfaWQmY3Q9Zw/rhZr8u3cvxe0ksf1ej/giphy.gif)

Welcome to my personal NVIM profile settings! 🎉 This collection of NVIM scripts respectively Plugins, Themes, etc are designed to bring your personaltouch to the NVIM text editor. There is still a lot of room for improvement.

Deliberately, the workflow was set up without any AI tools integration - try to learn first without AI completion or code generation respectively vibe code approaches to deepen your skillset. 

![vibe-my-nutsack](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/b4767f_90ae71aaea36471b8387702a17c1aed2~mv2.jpeg/v1/fill/w_925,h_520,al_c,q_85,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,enc_avif,quality_auto/b4767f_90ae71aaea36471b8387702a17c1aed2~mv2.jpeg)

It is also worth noting that that there are more things to think about than efficiency and productivity. It is also about doing what you love - if you love coding keep doing it yourself even if the computer might be better at it than you! Don't become one of those pseudo-intellectuals who let AI do everything and let it decide what to think about.

Be curious and put in the effort yourself and understand how things actually work! It's more fun to be competent!

### Plugins 🌟

All plugins have .lua configuration files which are stored in a dedicated directory `C:\Users\<username>\.config\nvim\samolb\lazy`. 

![plug](https://media0.giphy.com/media/v1.Y2lkPTc5MGI3NjExcGFxcXFvYW11OXZ5YmNjcjdmZzh0b3NjdWw1ZzEzdzFsbW1wbzQwbSZlcD12MV9pbnRlcm5hbF9naWZfYnlfaWQmY3Q9Zw/BZhvKu7MT0n2voRhtf/giphy.gif)
